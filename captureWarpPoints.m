function captureWarpPoints(imageName)
% Usage:  createWarpPoints is a gui program that enables a user to create a cell array of [x y] points 
%  that can be used in the warpImage function to warp an image.  By clicking the mouse on the points in the loaded image window (which contains the
%  picture given by the argument "imageName"), that correspond to the points in the reference image, the points are recorded in a cell array 
%  and written to disk under the name "imageName".pts.mat.  To undo a recorded point, press the space button.
%
% Input:  the name of the image file that one wants to capture the points from
%
% Output:  A file of points will be written to disk under the name "imageName".pts.mat
%
% Note: one can change the reference image and/or the number of points to be recorded by replacing the files "refImage.jpg" and "refPoints.mat"
